 Unless you are a BYOND guru who is curious how this works,
 there is no point in reading this file.  It's just the gritty
 code, and you NEVER need to touch it or even read it.

 See eventloop.dm for full library documentation.

 If you touch this file and then your event loop breaks,
 don't bug me about it, it's not my problem.
